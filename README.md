# Emergency Medical Portal

🚀 **A Smart Solution for Healthcare** 🚀

Emergency Medical Portal is a web-based system designed to streamline emergency medical record access securely and efficiently. This project was developed during the ACM Hackathon at PDEU by our team: **Hit Sheth, Kavan Trivedi, Raj Gandhi, and Patel Priyank**.

## 🔍 What does it do?

In critical situations, quick access to patient history can save lives. Our platform allows authorized personnel to securely retrieve medical records using Aadhaar numbers. This helps doctors make informed decisions instantly, ensuring better emergency care.

### Key Features:

- ✅ **Secure Admin Login**: Only authorized personnel can access records.
- ✅ **Store & Manage Medical Records**: Includes past history, critical reports, age, blood group, and more.
- ✅ **Retrieve Records via Aadhaar**: Find patient history quickly using Aadhaar authentication.
- ✅ **Future Upgrade - QR-Based Access**: Each Aadhaar-linked record has a unique ID, allowing us to generate a QR code for instant access. Patients could keep this QR as a wallpaper for quick scanning, eliminating the need for Aadhaar input.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: TypeScript, JavaScript, CSS
- **Backend & Database**: PostgreSQL with hashed credentials for security

## 💻 How it Works

1. **Secure Login**: Admins log in to access the portal.
2. **Record Management**: Admins can store and manage patient medical records.
3. **Aadhaar-Based Retrieval**: Medical records can be retrieved using Aadhaar numbers.
4. **Future QR Code Integration**: QR codes will allow instant access to records.
